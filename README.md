graphql nodejs server using dj.json (for data) w/ react client.


### Functionality

I wanted to create a simple solution for serving json files to a react client via graphql - for when
an entire database is overkill.

### Installing

cd into server folder

```
yarn
```

then to run

```
yarn start
```

now cd into client folder

```
yarn
```

then to run

```
yarn start
```

### Changing json data

Simply edit the db.json file in the server directory to add/edit data.
Please note: If you wish to add other 'tables' or fields you will need to add code to schema.js.
